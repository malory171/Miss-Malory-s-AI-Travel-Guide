          <h2>Country Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>French Polynesia</strong> is an overseas collectivity of
            France, located in the South Pacific Ocean. It consists of 118
            islands scattered over an area as large as Europe, but only 67
            islands are inhabited. These islands are grouped into five main
            archipelagos: the Society Islands (which include Tahiti and Bora
            Bora), the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Marquesas Islands, the Gambier
            Islands, and the Austral Islands. Known for its dramatic landscapes,
            French Polynesia boasts lush mountains, crystal-clear lagoons, and
            coral reefs, making it a favorite destination for those seeking
            natural beauty and relaxation.
          </p>

          <h2>Population</h2>
          <p>
            As of 2023, French Polynesia has a population of about 280,000
            people, with more than two-thirds of the population living on the
            island of Tahiti, home to the capital city, Papeete. The population
            is predominantly Polynesian, but there are also French and Chinese
            communities, contributing to the cultural diversity of the region.
          </p>

          <h2>Languages Spoken</h2>
          <p>
            The official language of French Polynesia is French, used in
            government, education, and media. However, Tahitian (Reo Tahiti) is
            widely spoken and is a key element of cultural identity for the
            indigenous Polynesians. Many inhabitants also speak English,
            especially in tourist-heavy areas, as well as other Polynesian
            dialects depending on the island group.
          </p>

          <h2>Cuisine</h2>
          <p>
            French Polynesian cuisine is an exotic blend of Polynesian, French,
            and Asian influences. A staple of the local diet is seafood, often
            freshly caught from the surrounding lagoons and oceans. Some of the
            most iconic dishes include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              fish marinated in lime juice and coconut milk, often served with
              vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>French Pastries:</strong> Due to French influence, bread
              and pastries, such as baguettes and croissants, are commonly
              enjoyed, even in remote islands.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tropical Fruits:</strong> Pineapple, papaya, mango, and

              <strong>Bora Bora:</strong> Known worldwide for its luxurious
              overwater bungalows, turquoise lagoons, and white-sand beaches,

              bustling market (March√© de Papeete) where visitors can purchase

              paradise with coral reefs teeming with marine life, including
              dolphins, manta rays, and sharks. The Pink Sands Beach and the

            <li>

              steep cliffs, deep valleys, and ancient archaeological sites. They
              are a must-visit for adventure travelers seeking authentic
              Polynesian culture and untamed nature.
            </li>

          <h2>Culture and Traditions</h2>
          <p>
            French Polynesia has a rich cultural heritage deeply rooted in
            Polynesian traditions. Dance and music play an important role, with
            the <em>‚ÄòOri Tahiti</em> (Tahitian dance) being a major part of
            festivities. The Heiva festival, held annually in July, showcases
            traditional dance, music, and sports. Polynesian tattooing, once
            considered a sacred art form, is still prevalent today and holds
            cultural significance. Local crafts, such as wood carvings, woven
            hats, and tapa cloth, are also central to the culture.
          </p>

            paradise-like landscapes, rich cultural experiences, and a blend of
